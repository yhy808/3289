NEURON mod files for the slow and fast K+ currents from the paper:
Voltage-gated K+ channels in layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurones from young rats: subtypes and gradients
A. Korngreen and B. Sakmann, *J.Physiol.* 525.3, 621-639 (2000).

- The kinetics.hoc file reproduces Fig.4 and Fig.7 of the paper
using the kinetic parameters as calculated by the authors using
a pharmacological separation of the currents. 
The activation and deactivation currents were simulated
using the voltage clamp values and protocols indicated
in Fig.4B and 7B with a -21mV reversal potential, because of
the 65mM K+ concentration used in the bath.

- The parameter C2 on the caption of fig.7 
for the deactivation time constant of the slow current
should be 175.03 instead of 1.15.

- The peak conductances have been arbitrary set to values
giving approximately the same current in the simulations
of Figs.4B and 7B.

Under unix systems:
-------------------
to compile the mod files use the command 
``` nrnivmodl ``` 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
``` nrngui kinetics.hoc ```

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
-------------------------------
to compile the mod files use the ```mknrndll``` command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.
